  "quickStart": "# Quick Start\n\nWelcome to Behaviors! Here's a guide to get you started.\n\n## Step 1: Create Your First Behavior\n\n1. Place a token on your map\n2. Right-click the token and select \"Edit Behaviors\"\n3. Find the 'immediately' hat block that's pre-populated in your script\n4. Add a \"say\" block from the Looks category and connect it below the hat block\n5. Type a message like \"Hello World!\" in the say block\n\n![Creating your first behavior](/docs/assets/creating-first-behavior.gif)\n\n## Step 2: Test It Out\n\nSave the script and and watch your token say your message!\n\n![Testing the behavior](/docs/assets/testing-behavior.gif)\n\n## Step 3: Try Something More Advanced\n\n1. Edit the same token's behaviors again\n2. Add a \"move forward\" block after the \"say\" block\n3. Set the distance to 2 grid cells\n4. Save and test - now your token will speak and move!\n\n## What's Next?\n\n-   Explore the different block categories in the toolbox\n-   Try some of the scripts from the 'Ideas' tab\n-   Try using tags to create specialized behaviors\n-   Use broadcasts to make tokens communicate with each other\n-   Add sound effects to make behaviors more engaging\n\nYou're ready to bring your tokens to life!\n",
  "howToUse": "# How to Use\n\n## Getting Started\n\n![Creating your first behavior](/docs/assets/creating-first-behavior.gif)\n\n1. **Right-click any token** on your Owlbear Rodeo map to open the context menu\n2. **Select \"Edit Behaviors\"** to open the visual block editor\n3. **Drag blocks** from the toolbox to create your token's behavior\n4. **Connect blocks** together to build complex behaviors\n5. **Save your work** and watch your token come to life!\n\n![Testing the behavior](/docs/assets/testing-behavior.gif)\n\n## Basic Concepts\n\n### Blocks\n\n-   **Event blocks** (hat-shaped): Trigger when something happens (like \"when selected\" or \"when message received\")\n-   **Action blocks**: Make your token do something (move, change appearance, play sound)\n-   **Control blocks**: Add logic like loops, conditions, and delays\n-   **Sensing blocks**: Check conditions about the token or scene\n\n### Tags\n\n-   **Add tags** to tokens to group them or create specialized behaviors\n-   Edit tags from the right-click behaviors menu for an item\n-   Tags are visible in the main Behaviors panel for easy management\n\n### Broadcasting Messages\n\n-   **Send messages** between tokens using broadcast blocks\n-   Create coordinated behaviors across multiple tokens\n-   Send messages from the main Behaviors panel as well as from behavior scripts\n\n![Sending a Message](/docs/assets/sending-message.gif)\n\n### Sounds\n\n-   **Add sound effects** to make behaviors more engaging\n-   Link audio files through the sound management panel\n-   Use \"play sound\" blocks in your behaviors\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Variables\n\n-   Create variables to store and manipulate data\n-   Use variables for counters, scores, or state tracking\n-   Variables reset when the page is reloaded or when you save the behavior script\n\n### Motion\n\n-   Move tokens smoothly with glide blocks\n-   Note that when players switch back to Owlbear Rodeo after being in another tab, all updates that occurred since their last visit will play forward, so your animations may appear jerky.\n-   In the 'go' block, the '‚è©' option means to move the token in the direction it's facing. In Owlbear Rodeo, 0 degrees rotation means a token is facing up. A token will face in the direction of its rotation handle.\n\n### Selection Control\n\n-   'When I am selected' blocks fire no matter who selects the token\n-   'Deselect' blocks apply to all players\n\n### Other Extensions\n\n-   Behaviors can integrate with other extensions. Blocks for controlling other extensions are in the 'extensions' section of the block toolbox. You must have the other extension installed in order for Behaviors to integrate with it.\n\n## Tips\n\n### Best Practices\n\n-   **Start simple**: Begin with basic \"when message received\" behaviors before building complex interactions\n-   **Test frequently**: Save and test your behaviors often to catch issues early\n-   **Use comments**: Add comment blocks to document complex behaviors\n-   **Organize blocks**: Keep related blocks close together for easier reading\n-   **Don't overwhelm Owlbear Rodeo**: Running many behaviors at once (especially animations) may cause the VTT to glitch out or drop updates.\n\n### Sharing Behaviors\n\nTo share behavior scripts between tokens, you have a few options:\n\n-   **Duplicate a token**. The easy option. When you duplicate a token, its behaviors are copied.\n-   **Prefabs**. To share tokens with behaviors between scenes, save the token as a prefab with the Prefabs extension. When you insert the prefab, the behaviors come with it.\n-   **Backpack**. You can drag scripts to the backpack icon in the top right of your block workspace to put them in your backpack, and click the backpack to open it while editing any token. Block stacks saved to your backpack are saved to your browser's local storage, so they'll persist across scenes and even rooms.\n\n![Using the Backpack](/docs/assets/backpack.gif)\n",
  "ideas": "# Ideas\n\nHere are some example behavior scripts to inspire you.\n\n## Zombie Chase\n\n![Zombie chase script](/docs/assets/zombie-script.svg)\n\nApply this script to several zombie tokens to have them chase the closest player when you send a message.\n\n![Zombie chase demo](/docs/assets/zombie-chase.gif)\n\n## Button\n\n![Button script](/docs/assets/button-script.svg)\n\nThis script makes a token or shape act as a button - locked in place, and when you double click it, it sends a message.\n\n![Button demo](/docs/assets/button.gif)\n\n(How do you edit the button again now that selecting it fires a behavior? Use the 'edit directly' tool from the Behaviors action panel to modify its behaviors without selecting it)\n"
