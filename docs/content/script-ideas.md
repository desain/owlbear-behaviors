Here are some example behavior scripts to inspire you.

## Zombie Chase

Apply this script to several zombie tokens to have them chase the closest player when you send a message.

## Button

This script makes a token or shape act as a button - locked in place, and when you double click it, it sends a message.

(How do you edit the button again now that selecting it fires a behavior? Use the 'edit directly' tool from the Behaviors action panel to modify its behaviors without selecting it)
