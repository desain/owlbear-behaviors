# Quick Start

Welcome to Behaviors! Here's a guide to get you started.

## Step 1: Create Your First Behavior

1. Place a token on your map
2. Right-click the token and select "Edit Behaviors"
3. Find the 'immediately' hat block that's pre-populated in your script
4. Add a "say" block from the Looks category and connect it below the hat block
5. Type a message like "Hello World!" in the say block

## Step 2: Test It Out

Save the script and and watch your token say your message!

## Step 3: Try Something More Advanced

1. Edit the same token's behaviors again
2. Add a "move forward" block after the "say" block
3. Set the distance to 2 grid cells
4. Save and test - now your token will speak and move!

## What's Next?

-   Try some of the scripts from the 'Ideas' tab
-   Try using tags to create specialized behaviors
-   Use broadcasts to make tokens communicate with each other
-   Add sound effects to make behaviors more engaging

You're ready to bring your tokens to life!
